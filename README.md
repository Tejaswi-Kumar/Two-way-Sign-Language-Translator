**Sign language is a visual language that is used by deaf people as their mother tongue. Unlike acoustically conveyed sound patterns, sign language uses body language and manual communication to fluidly convey the thoughts of a person. Due to considerable time required in learning the Sign Language, it becomes difficult to communicate with these specially abled people, and thus creates a communication gap.**
